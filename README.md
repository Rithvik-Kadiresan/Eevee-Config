<h1>Eevee Config</h1>
Eevee Config is a useful add-on that configures all Eevee settings such as Bloom, S.S.R with Refraction, Motion Blur and Ambient Occulusion all with one hotkey: **CTRL E**. Eevee Config also adds a Light Probe and turns on Auto Baking Lighting all with the same hotkey. This can also be done with a button created by this addon under Scene Settings> Eevee Config.
